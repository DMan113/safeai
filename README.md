SafeAI_Project
--------------
The SafeAI project is a prototype of a safe artificial intelligence system
that uses a modular approach to integrate:
1. **Internal State** - Algorithmic process calculations.
2. **External Feedback** - Feedback collection, audits, and ethics compliance.
3. **Controlled Randomness** - Measured creativity.

Purpose:
--------
This project demonstrates the concept of adaptive learning and AI self-correction
in environments where safety is critical. It highlights the importance of modular architecture
and risk management in AI systems.

Formula:
--------
The iterative state update is performed using the formula:

F(x, t+1) = (f(x, t) * A) * (O(x, t) * B) * (R(x, t) * C) * F(x, t)

Where:
- A, B, C are weight coefficients adaptively regulating the influence of each module.

Features:
----------
1. Modular Design: Independent modules for Internal State, External Feedback, and Randomness ensure scalability and easy integration.
2. Adaptive Corrections: Real-time adjustments of system behavior based on safety thresholds.
3. Graphical Analysis: Visualization of state history (`F`) and volatility over time.

Use Case Scenarios:
--------------------
SafeAI can be implemented in industries or environments where adaptive safety and feedback mechanisms are critical:
1. Healthcare AI: Ensuring safe decision-making in adaptive diagnostic tools.
2. Autonomous Systems: Providing robust feedback-driven learning for drones or vehicles.
3. Ethical AI Audits: Tracking and correcting model behavior within predefined thresholds.

Getting Started:
----------------
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/DMan113/safeai.git`
   `cd safeai`

2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the simulation:
   `python main.py`

Quick Start Example:
---------------------
Run the following command to see the system in action:
`python main.py`

Expected Output:
----------------
- Adaptive updates to the state (`F`) and visualization of volatility across 30 iterations.
- Example log output:
  Iteration 1: F = 1.023 (multiplier = 1.023)
  Iteration 2: F = 1.034 (multiplier = 1.010)
  ...

Example Output:
---------------
Upon running `main.py`, the system generates:
1. **F Value History Graph** - Demonstrates the changes in state `F` over time.
2. **Volatility Analysis Graph** - Shows the deviation of `F` from its initial state.

Dependencies:
--------------
The project uses the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
