# SafeAI_Project

The SafeAI project is a prototype of a safe artificial intelligence system that uses a modular approach to integrate:
- **Internal State** (algorithmic process calculations),
- **External Feedback** (feedback collection, audit, and ethics compliance),
- **Controlled Randomness** (measured creativity).

The iterative state update is performed using the formula:

\[
F(x, t+1) = \Bigl(f(x,t)\,A \cdot O(x,t)\,B \cdot R(x,t)\,C\Bigr) \cdot F(x,t)
\]

where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) are weight coefficients adaptively regulating the influence of each module.

The project demonstrates the concept of adaptive learning and safe AI self-correction.
